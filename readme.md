<u>CHANGES FOR NEW PUSH </u>
****

<b> new model can now give accuracy and tell the user where it is and isnt confident. EG model isnt sure for jd after 2026 and not sure after 2027 for visa. NEED to look into why this is happening. current prediction is trends.

More models can now be  used all needed to be done is add the data set via python and then call the csv in the command line as well as how many years you want the prediction to run for.


an example of how the program can be called is

</b>
python SR-19.06.25.py --csv visa_stock_up_to_date.csv --years 10;
